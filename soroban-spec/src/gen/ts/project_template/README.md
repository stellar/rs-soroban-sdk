# abundance-token JS

JS library for interacting with [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) smart contract `abundance-token` via Soroban RPC.

This library was automatically generated by Soroban CLI using a command similar to:

```bash
soroban contract bindings ts \
  --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443/soroban/rpc \
  --network-passphrase "Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022" \
  --id 2c6c3b8ba9923d029d8ef7eb80080384b1da32bcf0698290119fdfbf3f2a01de \
  --name abundance-token
```

It uses these settings by default, but you can override them with environment variables if you need to:

- **Contract ID**: `2c6c3b8ba9923d029d8ef7eb80080384b1da32bcf0698290119fdfbf3f2a01de`

  Override with environment variable `SOROBAN_ABUNDANCE_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID` or `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_ABUNDANCE_TOKEN_CONTRACT_ID`

- **RPC endpoint**: `https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443/soroban/rpc`

  Override with environment variable `SOROBAN_RPC_URL` or `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_RPC_URL`

- **Network Passphrase**: `Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022`

  Override with environment variable `SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE` or `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_PASSPHRASE`

- **Freighter Network Name**: `FUTURENET`

  What's this? [Freighter](https://www.freighter.app/) is the only signer/wallet supported for now. The [`signTransaction` method](https://docs.freighter.app/docs/guide/usingfreighternode/#signtransaction) requires a [specific naming convention](https://github.com/stellar/freighter/blob/7158e5f3b0bcb6b8d9086312955d1ce94352410e/%40shared/constants/stellar.ts#L12) for different networks.

  Override with environment variable `SOROBAN_NETWORK_NAME` or `PUBLIC_SOROBAN_NETWORK_NAME`

# Use it

You don't need to publish this library to NPM to use it. You can add it to your project's `package.json` using a file path:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "abundance-token": "./path/to/this/folder"
  }
}
```

Then you can import it into your editor and see inline documentation for all of its exports:

```js
import * as abundanceToken from "abundance-token"

abundanceToken.|
```

As long as your editor is configured to show JavaScript/TypeScript documentation, you can pause your typing at that `|` to get a list of all exports and inline-documentation for each. It exports a separate [async](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) function for each method in the smart contract, with documentation for each generated from the comments the contract's author included in the original source code.
