// Most host functions have strong contractual guarantees from the host: they
// will either return the correctly-typed objects here, or they will trap. So we
// do not need to check return types, and we can even unsafely downcast Vals to
// specific subtypes if we know them.
//
// (Recall that there must be no way for the guest to corrupt the host even if
// the guest does receive unexpected objects -- at worst the host can corrupt or
// confuse the guest this way, but the guest can never defend itself against a
// malicious host anyways.)
//
// We do this mostly to minimize codesize, and also reduce the chance of users
// missing an error in a contract binding to another language that doesn't have
// Result<> types. Every error that can trap this way typically has a way to
// avoid it by checking some value first (eg. check a map to see if it contains
// a value before getting it).
//
// The exceptions are ledger-interaction calls and especially cross-contract
// calls: these we project into a Result<> because they are fairly failure-prone
// and impossible to guard against failure of, typically. We assume users might
// wish to contain these and, in general, that users won't be doing a _ton_ of
// them so it's ok that they are a little more expensive code-size-wise.
