# Exclude proc-macro crates from the workspace so that when building the
# workspace their dependencies do not pollute the feature selection of other
# crates. Ordinarily when you build a proc-macro crate as a dependency of
# another crate, the proc-macro crate's dependencies are decoupled from the
# dependencies of other crates. This has an important side-effect of not
# unifiying the features selected in shared dependencies. When a proc-macro
# crate is part of a workspace and the workspace as a whole is built the
# proc-macro is seen as a first-class crate and its dependencies, including
# their feature selection, affects the overall dependency graph used to build
# all crates. This has an unfortunate side-effect for proc-macro crates, like
# 'macros', that depend on std features when other crates, like 'sdk',
# explicitly must not depend on std. Hopefully one day this will be fixed in:
