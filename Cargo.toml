    # Exclude proc-macro crates from the workspace so that when building the
    # workspace their dependencies do not pollute the feature selection of other
    # crates. Ordinarily when you build a proc-macro crate as a dependency of
    # another crate, the proc-macro crate's dependencies are decoupled from the
    # dependencies of other crates. This has an important side-effect of not
    # unifiying the features selected in shared dependencies. When a proc-macro
    # crate is part of a workspace and the workspace as a whole is built the
    # proc-macro is seen as a first-class crate and its dependencies, including
    # their feature selection, affects the overall dependency graph used to build
    # all crates. This has an unfortunate side-effect for proc-macro crates, like
    # 'macros', that depend on std features when other crates, like 'sdk',
    # explicitly must not depend on std. Hopefully one day this will be fixed in:
    # https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/10827

    # Exclude crates that are not intended for building on the wasm32 target, so
    # that the majority of cargo-hack usage won't trigger builds on these crates
    # in isolation, but these crates will still be built when the SDK gets built
    # because they're named as a dependency.
