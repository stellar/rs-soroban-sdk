# NB: For the time being (until we find a better solution, or abandon `no-std`
# in the guest) we need to specify the stellar-xdr dependency for the the env
# crate (pulled in transitively from the SDK crate) and the macros (this crate)
# with _different versions_ of the stellar-xdr crate.
#
# To repeat (this is weird): ensure the rev="..." specified in this file is a
# _different_ rev than the one specified in
# https://github.com/stellar/rs-stellar-contract-env/blob/main/stellar-contract-env-common/Cargo.toml
#
# This is because the macros activate the `std` feature (as visible here) and
# the guest crate when compiled to wasm requires _not_ activating the `std`
# feature, to include a custom panic handler.
#
# If cargo resolves both dependencies to a single version of stellar-xdr, it
# will enable the `std` feature in that "shared" version. If on the other hand
# (as a total hack) we depend on two _different_ versions of stellar-xdr, we can
# configure them with separate features. Which is what we're doing (for now).
