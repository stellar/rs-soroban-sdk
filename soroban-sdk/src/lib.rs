/// __link_sections returns and does nothing, but it contains link sections that
/// should be ensured end up in the final build of any contract using the SDK.
///
/// In Rust's build system sections only get included into the final build if
/// the object file containing those sections are processed by the linker, but
/// as an optimization step if no code is called in an object file it is
/// discarded.  This has the unfortunate effect of causing anything else in
/// those object files, such as link sections, to be discarded. Placing anything
/// that must be included in the build inside an exported function ensures the
/// object files won't be discarded. wasm-bindgen does a similar thing to this,
/// and so this seems to be a reasonably accepted way to work around this
/// limitation in the build system.
///
/// This has an unfortunate side-effect that all contracts will have a function
/// in the resulting WASM named `_`, however this function won't be rendered in
/// the contract specification. The overhead of this is very minimal on file
/// size.
