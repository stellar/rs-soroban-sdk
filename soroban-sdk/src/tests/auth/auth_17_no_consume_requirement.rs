//! Demonstrates how an authorization is not required to be consumed by an
//! invocation.
//!
//! It's possible to have dangling authorizations that may be optionally
//! consumed, or never consumed.
//!
//! Because authorizations cannot always be grouped, it's not possible to group
//! potentially related optional auths together to ensure. This means it's
//! possible for an auth to be exposed on chain that could be executed by
//! someone in isolation, even after the transaction succeeds.
