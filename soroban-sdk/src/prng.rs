//! Prng contains a pseudo-random number generator.
//!
//! ## Warning
//!
//! Do not use the PRNG in this module without a clear understanding of two
//! major limitations in the way it is deployed in the Stellar network:
//!
//!   1. The PRNG is seeded with data that is public as soon as each ledger is
//!      nominated. Therefore it **should never be used to generate secrets**.
//!
//!   2. The PRNG is seeded with data that is under the control of validators.
//!      Therefore it **should only be used in applications where the risk of
//!      validator influence is acceptable**.
//!
//! The PRNG in this module is a strong CSPRNG (ChaCha20) and can be manually
//! re-seeded by contracts, in order to support commit/reveal schemes, oracles,
//! or similar advanced types of pseudo-random contract behaviour. Any PRNG is
//! however only as strong as its seed.
//!
//! The network runs in strict consensus, so every node in the network seeds its
//! PRNG with a consensus value, **not a random entropy source**. It uses data
//! that is generally difficult to predict in advance, and generally difficult
//! for network **users** to bias to a specific value: the seed is derived from
//! the overall transaction-set hash and the hash-sorted position number of each
//! transaction within it. But this seed is **not secret** and **not
//! cryptographically hard to bias** if a corrupt **validator** were to choose
//! to do so (similar to the way a corrupt validator can bias overall
//! transaction admission in the network).
//!
//! In other words the network will provide a stronger seed than a contract
//! could likely derive on-chain using any other public data visible to it (eg.
//! better than using a timestamp, ledger number, counter, or a similarly weak
//! seed) but weaker than a contract could acquire using a commit/reveal scheme
//! with an off-chain source of trusted random entropy.
//!
//! You should carefully consider whether these limitations are acceptable for
//! your application before using this module.
//!
//! ## Operation
//!
//! The host has a single hidden "base" PRNG that is seeded by the network. The
//! base PRNG is then used to seed separate, independent "local" PRNGs for each
//! contract invocation. This independence has the following characteristics:
//!
//!   - Contract invocations can only access (use or reseed) their local PRNG.
//!   - Contract invocations cannot influence any other invocation's local PRNG,
//!     except by influencing the other invocation to make a call to its PRNG.
//!   - Contracts cannot influence the base PRNG that seeds local PRNGs, except
//!     by making calls and thereby creating new local PRNGs with new seeds.
//!   - A contract invocation's local PRNG maintains state through the life of
//!     the invocation.
//!   - That state is advanced by each call from the invocation to a PRNG
//!     function in this module.
//!   - A contract invocation's local PRNG is destroyed after the invocation.
//!   - Any re-entry of a contract counts as a separate invocation.
//!
//! ## Testing
//!
//! In local tests, the base PRNG of each host is seeded to zero when the host
//! is constructed, so each contract invocation's local PRNG seed (and all its
//! PRNG-derived calls) will be determined strictly by its order of invocation
//! in the test. Assuming this order is stable, each test run should see stable
//! output from the local PRNG.
