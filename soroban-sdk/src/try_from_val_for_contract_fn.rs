//! TryFromValForContractFn is an internal trait that is used by code generated
//! for the export of contract functions. The generated code calls the trait to
//! convert incoming Val's into their respective SDK types.
//!
//! The trait has a blanket implementation for all types that already implement
//! TryFromVal<_, Val>.
//!
//! The trait exists primarily to allow some special types, e.g.
//! [`crate::crypto::Hash`], to be used as inputs to contract functions without
//! otherwise being createable from a Val via the public TryFromVal trait, and
//! therefore not storeable.
//!
//! For types that can be used and converted everywhere, implementing TryFromVal
//! is most appropriate. For types that should only be used and converted to as
//! part of contract function invocation, then this trait is appropriate.
