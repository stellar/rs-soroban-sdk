// at commit b3c188f48dec51a956c1380fb6fe92201a3f716b.

// Differences between this interface and the built-in contract
// 1. The return values here don't return Results.
// 2. The implementations have been replaced with a panic.

/// Interface for Token contracts, such as the Stellar Asset Contract.
///
/// Defined by [SEP-41].
///
/// [SEP-41]: https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/blob/master/ecosystem/sep-0041.md
///
/// The token interface provides the following functionality.
///
/// If a contract implementing the interface does not support some of the
/// functionality, it should return an error.
///
/// The interface does not define any set of standard errors. Errors can be
/// defined by the implementing contract.
///
/// ## Meta
///
/// Tokens implementing the interface expose meta functions about the token:
/// - [`decimals`][Self::decimals]
/// - [`name`][Self::name]
/// - [`symbol`][Self::symbol]
///
/// ## Balances
///
/// Tokens track a balance for each address that holds the token. Tokens implementing the interface expose
/// a single function for getting the balance that an address holds:
/// - [`balance`][Self::balance]
///
/// ## Transfers
///
/// Tokens allow holders of the token to transfer tokens to other addresses.
/// Tokens implementing the interface expose a single function for doing so:
/// - [`transfer`][Self::transfer]
///
/// ## Burning
///
/// Tokens allow holders of the token to burn, i.e. dispose of, tokens without
/// transferring them to another holder. Tokens implementing the interface
/// expose a single function for doing so:
/// - [`burn`][Self::burn]
///
/// ## Allowances
///
/// Tokens can allow holders to permit others to transfer amounts from their
/// balance using the following functions.
/// - [`allowance`][Self::allowance]
/// - [`approve`][Self::approve]
/// - [`transfer_from`][Self::transfer_from]
/// - [`burn_from`][Self::burn_from]
///
/// ## Minting
///
/// There are no functions in the token interface for minting tokens. Minting is
/// an administrative function that can differ significantly from one token to
/// the next.
