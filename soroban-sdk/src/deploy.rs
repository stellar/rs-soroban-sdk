//! Deploy contains types for deploying contracts.
//!
//! Contracts are assigned an ID that is derived from a set of arguments. A
//! contract may choose which set of arguments to use to deploy with:
//!
//! - [Deployer::with_current_contract] â€“ A contract deployed by the currently
//! executing contract will have an ID derived from the currently executing
//! contract's ID.
//!
//! The deployer can be created using [Env::deployer].
//!
//! ### Examples
//!
//! #### Deploy a contract without constructor (or 0-argument constructor)
//!
//! ```
//! use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, BytesN, Env, Symbol};
//!
//! const DEPLOYED_WASM: &[u8] = include_bytes!("../doctest_fixtures/contract.wasm");
//! #[contract]
//! pub struct Contract;
//! #[contractimpl]
//! impl Contract {
//!     pub fn deploy(env: Env, wasm_hash: BytesN<32>) {
//!         let salt = [0u8; 32];
//!         let deployer = env.deployer().with_current_contract(salt);
//!         // Deployed contract address is deterministic and can be accessed
//!         // before deploying the contract.
//!         let _ = deployer.deployed_address();
//!         let contract_address = deployer.deploy(wasm_hash);
//!     }
//! }
//! #[test]
//! fn test() {
//! # }
//! # #[cfg(feature = "testutils")]
//! # fn main() {
//!     let env = Env::default();
//!     let contract_address = env.register(Contract, ());
//!     let contract = ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_address);
//!     // Upload the contract code before deploying its instance.
//!     let wasm_hash = env.deployer().upload_contract_wasm(DEPLOYED_WASM);
//!     contract.deploy(&wasm_hash);
//! }
//! # #[cfg(not(feature = "testutils"))]
//! # fn main() { }
//! ```
//!
//! //! #### Deploy a contract with a multi-argument constructor
//!
//! ```
//! use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, BytesN, Env, Symbol, IntoVal};
//! const DEPLOYED_WASM_WITH_CTOR: &[u8] = include_bytes!("../doctest_fixtures/contract_with_constructor.wasm");
//! #[contract]
