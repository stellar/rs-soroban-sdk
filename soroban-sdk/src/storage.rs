/// Storage stores and retrieves data for the currently executing contract.
///
/// All data stored can only be queried and modified by the contract that stores
/// it. Contracts cannot query or modify data stored by other contracts.
///
/// There are three types of storage - Temporary, Persistent, and Instance.
///
/// Temporary entries are the cheaper storage option and are never in the Expired State Stack (ESS). Whenever
/// a TemporaryEntry expires, the entry is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered.
/// This storage type is best for entries that are only relevant for short periods of
/// time or for entries that can be arbitrarily recreated.
///
/// Persistent entries are the more expensive storage type. Whenever
/// a persistent entry expires, it is deleted from the ledger, sent to the ESS
/// and can be recovered via an operation in Stellar Core. Only a single version of a
/// persistent entry can exist at a time.
///
/// Instance storage is used to store entries within the Persistent contract
/// instance entry, allowing users to tie that data directly to the expiration
/// on the instance. Instance storage is good for global contract data like
/// metadata, admin accounts, or pool reserves.
///
/// ### Examples
///
/// ```
/// use soroban_sdk::{Env, Symbol};
///
/// # use soroban_sdk::{contract, contractimpl, symbol_short, BytesN};
/// #
/// # #[contract]
/// # pub struct Contract;
/// #
/// # #[contractimpl]
/// # impl Contract {
/// #     pub fn f(env: Env) {
/// let storage = env.storage();
/// let key = symbol_short!("key");
/// storage.persistent().set(&key, &1);
/// assert_eq!(storage.persistent().has(&key), true);
/// assert_eq!(storage.persistent().get::<_, i32>(&key), Some(1));
/// #     }
/// # }
/// #
/// # #[cfg(feature = "testutils")]
/// # fn main() {
/// #     let env = Env::default();
/// #     let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, Contract);
/// #     ContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id).f();
/// # }
/// # #[cfg(not(feature = "testutils"))]
